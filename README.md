# Program Description

## Google Colab
Starting off, we use google colab as it helps us to use google services and while we are using it, we need not have to install several libraries in the local system as well as it allocates GPU which help the smooth implementation of the code.

## Tensorflow- MobileNetV2
For training of our model, we used Tensorflow as it offers a very high level and abstract approach to organizing low-level numerical programming.

## Dataset
We have used around 1600 images combined of people wearing masks and of without masks. These all images along with the model and all the files are saved and extracted from google drive in order to give the user facility to use cloud services. 

The Flow of the projects is as follows:
1. Data augmentation
2. Loading the MobilNetV2 classifier
3. Building a new fully-connected (FC) head
4. Pre-processing
5. Loading image data
